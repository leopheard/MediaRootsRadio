Since 2010 Media Roots Radio has been a non-partisan, radical political podcast focusing on foreign policy, the police state and social issues hosted by former Breaking the Set (RT) host / journalist Abby Martin and co-hosted by her brother / filmmaker (A Very Heavy Agenda) Robbie Martin. Conversational, controversial and at times passionate and explicit, Media Roots stands apart from the majority of podcasts coming from a similar political POV.<br>
