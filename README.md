Media Roots Radio
=============================

A <a href="www.kodi.tv">KODI</a> / XBMC / Firestick audio addon for <a href="https://mediaroots.org/radio/">Media Roots Radio</a> - Media Roots is a citizen journalism project that reports the news from outside of party lines while providing a collaborative forum for conscious citizens, artists and activists to unite.<br>

Since 2010 Media Roots Radio has been a non-partisan, radical political podcast focusing on foreign policy, the police state and social issues hosted by former Breaking the Set (RT) host / journalist Abby Martin and co-hosted by her brother / filmmaker (A Very Heavy Agenda) Robbie Martin. Conversational, controversial and at times passionate and explicit, Media Roots stands apart from the majority of podcasts coming from a similar political POV.<br>
